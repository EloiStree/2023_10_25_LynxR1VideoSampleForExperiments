If you want to do experiment with unfolding image of the Lynx R1 recorded by ScrCopy. Here are some sample.

My goal here is to experiment some unfolding of the record on PC to replay it on phone "Viewmaster" like or on other headset for educational purpose.

As the community may have idea or may know how to code that.
Here are some sample for you to work with.

Feel free to ping me if you need more.

Kind regards,
Eloi
